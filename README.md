This project is something I started back in 2016 and worked on throughout most of 2017. I've redacted some information and cleared the packages, so a NuGet package restore should resolve any issues.

I haven't touched it in a while as I determined this core functionality isn't what I wanted to be done after some strong self-evaluation on my goals.
I've since moved to more modern methods of development, but this is a good project that I can share and shows my designing ability from about 5 years ago.

If more modern projects are requested, I can see about redacting some information from my current project to get this information shared.

Thanks,
William Wands Jr.
